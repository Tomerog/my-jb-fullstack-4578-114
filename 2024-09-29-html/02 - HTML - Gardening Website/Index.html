      Gardening may be a fun and relaxing way to get in touch with nature, but
      did you know that it also has plenty of health benefits? Gardening is an
      activity that’s good for both the mind and body, and can be enjoyed by
      people of all ages. Plus, you get to eat the delicious fruits, vegetables
      and herbs that you grow. So, grab your tools and get in the dirt! It only
      takes a little bit of gardening to work up a sweat. According to the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 2.5 hours of moderate
      activity each week can help reduce the risk of many health problems,
      including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes.
      You may not think of gardening as exercise, but all the lifting, shoveling
      and raking involved definitely counts, says Raychel Santo, MA, senior
      research program coordinator for the Center for a Livable Future at the
      Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Your brain also benefits
      from time spent in the garden. Being outside in the fresh air and sunshine
      is an effective way to boost your mood and de-stress. In fact, gardening
      has shown to be helpful in reducing the risk of depression. If something
      is weighing heavily on your mind, gardening can allow you to focus on an
      activity that will bring you joy.

      So many of my friends are what I’d call “garden curious.” The dream is
      simple: ample backyard space where they can grow their own food, compost,
      and live out their most cherished ideas for a greener life. The reality:
      Time and space are limited. But no one needs to wait for the perfect
      conditions to grow something. In my own experience with Lazy-Girl
      Gardening, I’ve seen the best results when I’ve embraced low-stakes
      experiments focused on food I love. I have grown tomatoes, peppers,
      lettuce greens, and herbs in my apartment; today, lemon-balm and mint
      plants I started from seed adorn my kitchen windowsill, and for the past
      two summers, I have grown sungold tomatoes in containers on the sliver of
      concrete I refer to as my “terrace.” Though it won’t bear fruit for the
      next five years, my pride and joy is a three-foot-tall plant I grew from a
      grocery-store avocado’s pit. Growing vegetables at a modest scale allowed
      me to reduce the carbon emissions associated with my diet in a small but
      meaningful way. My plants have saved me a few trips to the grocery store,
      to buy food shipped in from far away. It has also reconnected me to a
      sense of seasonality. And gardening, no matter the scale, is downright
      relaxing. Even if you don’t have an expansive permanent space to garden,
      consider following these three principles to start. Practical apartment
      gardening is an exercise in living better right now, instead of waiting
      for the right circumstances. The climate is changing fast enough that the
      best conditions for gardening might be whenever you start; paying
      attention to plants and how they grow will put you that much more in touch
      with those shifts. Embrace the Small In the world of plant-based
      lifestyles—think juicy monstera plants spread across the pages of Homes &
      Gardens and viral photos of Oprah harvesting ginormous vegetables—bigger
      is better. Against the standard established by the backyard jungles of
      HGTV, which I watched obsessively as a newbie gardener while living in an
      1,100-square-foot unit that I shared with two roommates, any plants I grew
      suddenly looked meager. Hoping to compete with plant parents in my circle
      and, yes, Oprah, I began to devise ingenious ways to grow plants in the
      limited space I had. I lined my room almost wall to wall with plant
      projects: a few attempts to grow peppers here. A trial of various broccoli
      varieties there. I even installed two hanging baskets in the ceiling,
      hoping to use the vertical space to grow butterhead lettuce. One day I
      awoke and couldn’t open my bedroom door. If I didn’t start thinking
      smaller, I’d be living on top of my plants, instead of among them.
